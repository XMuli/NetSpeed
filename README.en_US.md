### Background

‚Äã		I love `DDE`, I am a `Deepin` lover and one of the developers. The project was born because I was used to a taskbar speed plugin on other systems, but there was nothing similar on `Deepin/UOS`.

<br>

‚Äã		Provide a desktop fixed transparent window on `Linux`, `Windows`, `MacOS`, so that this window coordinates with the system desktop and can display the active status of internet speed, CPU, memory, disk, etc. in real time. Also available separately for `Win10` and `DDE (for lfxMonitorNet)` is the Taskbar Realtime Internet Speed plugin.

<br>

**lfxNet:** Create a `CPU` usage-rate transparent window fixed to the desktop (not open by default)

**lfxMonitorNet:** 

> **For detailed demonstration and running results, see üíò [README](https://github.com/xmuli/lfxNet/tree/master/dde-dock-plugin)** 

‚Äã		is a refactored version of [lfxspeed](https://github.com/xmuli/lfxspeed), at first, it was only for self-use to check the real-time network speed, then it was open-sourced in the community and people liked it, so I was very happy; then I decided to refactor and extend it to [lfxNet](https://github.com/xmuli/lfxsNet), the goal is to first write it for general purpose `Linux`, and then extend it to `Win` and `Mac` platforms at leisure, to display network speed, CPU, MEM and other information.

### Compile

After picking into the source directory, execute.

```bash
sudo apt install g++ cmake libqt5*-dev libdtk{core,widget,gui}-dev dde-dock-dev # dependencies

mkdir build && cd build # compile
cmake ...
make -j16

sudo make install # Install
```

**Note:** If it doesn't work, run `killall dde-dock` to restart the taskbar and it will take effect
